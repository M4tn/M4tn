## Hi there 👋

I'm a second-year IT student working towards becoming a Junior IT Systems Specialist. I'm interested in learning new programming languages. In my free time I either procrastinate, sleep, play video games or start working on something coding related. 

*Favourite Linux distro: Debian.*
